# Pneumonia_Detection
In this project, I've built a machine learning model to classify Chest X-ray images of patients into Normal (Not Infected) and Pneumonia (Infected Patients).
Majority of the Covid19 affected patients have developed severe pneumonia which makes it important to detect it fast and accurately in those patients, so that we can take immediate actions.
To make quick decisions, we can make use of image processing techniques along with machine learning models to detect pneumonia from the chest X-ray images.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is given below which consists of 5863 images in total (Normal and Pneumonia). 
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pcbreviglieri/pneumonia-xray-images) , which is an adapted version of Paul Mooney's 'Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)' [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
